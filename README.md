# NFL-QB-Clustering

This project looks to create tiers of quarterbacks based on 10 years of recent qb data. Being a diehard Dallas Cowboys fan, my main objective was to see what tier Dak Prescott falls into. I utilized scikit-learn libraries to classify NFL QBs into clusters. I used PCA for dimensionality reduction and the Kmeans algorithm for clustering. 

A Jupyter Notebook is included which breaks down my analysis. I provided the 10 years of QB dataset as a csv file. It includes both rushing and passing stats. This can be used as a starting point for any additional analysis.

All data was scraped from [pro-football reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/).
